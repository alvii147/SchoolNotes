# Inequality

## The Gini Coefficient

$$
\Large \text{Gini Coefficient} = \frac{n - 1}{n} - \frac{2}{n}\sum\limits^{n - 1}_{i = 1}s_i
$$

where $\large n$ is the number of groups sorted by income and $\large s_i$ is the cumulative income share of the groups $\large 1$ to $\large i$.

## Measure of Poverty

### The Market Basket Measure

The Market Basket Measure (MBM) is based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living. It includes the costs of food, clothing, shelter, transportation and other items for a reference family. These costs are compared to the disposable income of families to determine whether or not they fall below the poverty line.

### The Low Income Measure

The Low Income Measure (LIM) defines the poverty line at half the adjusted median household income.
