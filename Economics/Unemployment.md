# Unemployment

## Main Indicators

- Population (WAP): the number of persons of working age (15 years and over)
- Employment (E): the number of employed workers (total, full-time and part-time)
- Unemployment (U): the number of workers who are able and want to work but are not employed
- Labour force (LF): Employment + Unemployment
- Out of the labour force: It is not directly given, but it can be obtained using the other series. It is equal to Population minus Labour force. It includes discouraged workers, retirees, students, etc.
- Incidence (I): the proportion of individuals that become unemployed
- Duration (D): the duration is the average time each unemployed workers have been unemployed

$$
\Large LF = E + U
$$

$$
\Large UR = \frac{\text{U}}{\text{LF}} \times 100 = \Bigg( 1 - \frac{ER}{PR} \Bigg) \times 100
$$

$$
\Large PR = \frac{\text{LF}}{\text{WAP}} \times 100
$$

$$
\Large ER = \frac{\text{E}}{\text{WAP}} \times 100
$$

$$
\Large UR = D \times I
