# Time Series Components

A time series can be broken into 4 components:

- Trend, $\large T_t$
- Cyclical, $\large C_t$
- Seasonal, $\large S_t$
- Irregular, $\large I_t$

$$
\Large X_t = T_t + C_t + S_t + I_t
$$

## Additional Components

- The very low frequency component:  $\large T_t$
- The medium low frequency component:  $\large C_t$
- The medium high frequency component:  $\large S_t$
- The very high frequency component:  $\large I_t$
- The low frequency component:  $\large T_t + C_t$
- The high frequency component  $\large S_t + I_t$
