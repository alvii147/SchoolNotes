# Normal-Form Games

**Normal-form games** are games where:

- there is a finite set of agents $\large N = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$ that act simultaneously without the knowledge of other agents' actions
- every agent $\large i$ has a set of available actions, denoted by $\large A_i$, where the action taken by agent $\large i$ is denoted by $\large a_i \in A_i$
- the outcome is defined by an action profile $\large a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$, i.e. the set of actions taken by all agents (often also denoted by $\large a = (a_i, a_{-i})$)
- the set of all action profiles is denoted by $\large A = \prod\limits_i A_i$
- every agent $\large i$ has a utility function $\large u_i$ that maps an action profile to real numbers
- an action profile of all agents except agent $\large i$ is denoted by $\large a_{-i}$
- a set of action profiles of all agents except agent $\large i$ is denoted by $\large A_{-i} = \prod\limits_{i \ne j} A_j$
