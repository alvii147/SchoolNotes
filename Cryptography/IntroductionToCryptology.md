# Introduction to Cryptology

## Cryptology

**Cryptology** is the practice and study of constructing and analyzing codes for secure communication

## Cryptography

**Cryptography** is the study of the design of mathematical systems that allowing secure communication that aims to protect privacy and authenticity.

## Cryptanalysis

**Cryptanalysis**, the reverse function of cryptography, is the study of breaking encrypted codes without access to secret information (i.e. the key) required for decryption.

## NIST Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems

The NIST standard FIPS 199 (Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems ) lists **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** as the three security objectives for information and for information systems.

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality involves preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information. A loss of confidentiality is the unauthorized disclosure of information.

### Integrity

Integrity involves guarding against improper information modification or destruction, including ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity. A loss of integrity is the unauthorized modification or destruction of information.

### Availability

Availability involves ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information. A loss of availability is the disruption of access to or use of information or an information system.

## Block & Stream Ciphers

A **block cipher** breaks down plaintext messages into fixed-size blocks before converting them into ciphertext using a key. This is usually a permutation algorithm that maps $n$ bits to $n$ bits.

A **stream cipher** breaks a plaintext message down into single bits, which then are converted individually into ciphertext using key bits.

## Symmetric & Asymmetric Key Encryptions

**Symmetric encryption** is a widely used data encryption technique whereby data is encrypted and decrypted using a single, secret cryptographic key.

**Asymmetric encryption**, also known as public-key cryptography or public-key encryption, uses mathematically linked public-key and private-key pairs to encrypt and decrypt senders' and recipients' sensitive data.
